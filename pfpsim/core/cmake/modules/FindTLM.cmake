# - Find TLM
# This module finds if TLM is installed and determines where the
# include files and libraries are. This code sets the following
# variables: (from kernel/sc_ver.h)
#
#  TLM_VERSION_STRING     = Version of the package found, eg. "2.2.0"
#  TLM_VERSION_MAJOR      = The major version of the package found.
#  TLM_VERSION_MINOR      = The minor version of the package found.
#  TLM_VERSION_PATCH      = The patch version of the package found.
#  TLM_VERSION_DATE       = The date of release (from TLM_VERSION)
#  TLM_VERSION            = This is set to: $major.$minor.$patch
#
# The minimum required version of TLM can be specified using the
# standard CMake syntax, e.g. FIND_PACKAGE(TLM 2.2)
#
# For these components the following variables are set:
#
#  TLM_FOUND                    - TRUE if all components are found.
#  TLM_INCLUDE_DIRS             - Full paths to all include dirs.
#  TLM_LIBRARIES                - Full paths to all libraries.
#  TLM_<component>_FOUND        - TRUE if <component> is found.
#
# Example Usages:
#  FIND_PACKAGE(TLM)
#  FIND_PACKAGE(TLM 2.3)
